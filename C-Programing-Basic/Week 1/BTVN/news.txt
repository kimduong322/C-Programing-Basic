Belichick downplayed the "experience" of playing Brady as a coach.
"Look we went against Tom Brady every day, every day in practice defensively. 
So it's not like we've ever seen Tom Brady before," Belichick said. 
"They are a good football team and he's a great quarterback, and I think that's all – goes without saying."
Brady finished 22-for-43 with 269 passing yards. He didn’t have a touchdown pass.
Mac Jones led the Patriots into field-goal range, but Nick Folk couldn’t make a difficult 57-yard field goal in the pouring rain.
Brady and Belichick then met after the game for about 20 minutes. 
Belichick had already talked with the press before reporters started to reveal the two were meeting. 
Brady was asked about the meeting after the game and told the media their quick catch-up was planned beforehand.
