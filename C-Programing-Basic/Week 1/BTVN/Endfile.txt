The marriage between Princess Mako, the eldest daughter of Crown Prince Akishino, and Kei Komuro later this month will take place under extremely unusual circumstances.
There will be no engagement or wedding ceremonies out of consideration for the negative public opinion. As per her wishes, the princess will also forgo a one-off marriage allowance, which is normally given to female members of the Imperial family who lose their Imperial status upon marriage.The Yomiuri Shimbun
